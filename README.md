# ResNet50-ObjectDetection
This project involves training and evaluating the ResNet50 architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The ResNet50 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its excellent performance in image recognition tasks. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

The trained ResNet50 model achieved a test accuracy of 84.14% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, the F1 score obtained was 0.832, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.
